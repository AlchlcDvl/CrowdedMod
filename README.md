# CrowdedMod
This mod unlocks the possibility for more than 10 player to join in an Among Us lobby.
The official servers won't allow for it though, so you will have to host an [Impostor](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/Impostor) custom server (more in [docs](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master/docs)).
