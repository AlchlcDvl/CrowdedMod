# 100 Players Mod
This mod unlocks the possibility for more than 10 player to join in an Among Us lobby.
The official servers won't allow for it though, so you will have to host an [Impostor](https://github.com/AeonLucid/Impostor) custom server.

## Why 100 players?
This mod allows for up to 127 players (signed byte limit) because of game limitations (That's a lot of player anyway).
Hence the name itself derives from the [Impostor project](https://github.com/AeonLucid/Impostor) discord server 
discussion, in which "100 players mod when?" has become a meme.

## Limitations
By itself this mod doesn't allow to select more than 10 players or more than 3 impostors.
You will have to change those values by other means (e.g. Cheat Engine)

## Installation
Still working on a stable release, this could work, but some refinements are required.
