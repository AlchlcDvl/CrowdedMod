# CrowdedMod
This mod unlocks the possibility for more than 10 player to join in an Among Us lobby.
The official servers won't allow for it though, so you will have to host an [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) custom server (more in [docs](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master/docs)).

Works on Among Us Steam version from **v2020.12.9s** to **v2021.4.14s**.<br/>

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning:
> CrowdedMod uses Reactor's CustomRPC system.
> To properly play on the custom Impostor server, you have to
> 1. Disable anti-cheat, because it gets triggered by CustomRPCs
> 2. Use [patched Reactor 4.12s](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/787987336846770186/832930668907855872/Reactor-2021.4.12s.dll) or [patched Reactor 4.14s](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794122592617103360/838514462658658374/Reactor-2021.4.14s.dll) without a modded handshake because it wasn't yet implemented in Impostor
