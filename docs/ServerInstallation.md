## Server-side installation

Crowded Mod to work properly, needs custom Among Us server.<br/>
Latest Impostor version is incompatible with CrowdedMod, so you have to use our [fork](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/Impostor) You can download latest working build from [releases](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/Impostor/releases/tag/v1.3.0c)
### Installing custom Impostor server
See [Impostor docs](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/blob/dev/docs/Running-the-server.md). <br/>
