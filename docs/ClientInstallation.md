## Client mod installation
To make mod work, you need two pieces. Custom server [(Impostor) with custom plugin](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master-refactor/docs/ServerInstallation.md) and a client-side mod.
<br/>After installing this mod, you need to also [add custom server to the client menu](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master-refactor/docs/ServerSelection.md).
