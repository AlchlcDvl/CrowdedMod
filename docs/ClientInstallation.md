## Client mod installation
To make mod work, you need two pieces. Custom server [(Impostor)](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master-refactor/docs/ServerInstallation.md) and a client-side mod (CrowdedMod).
<br/>After installing this mod, you need to also [add custom server to the client menu](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master-refactor/docs/ServerSelection.md).
### Method 1 (the easiest)
Use dropship/launcher. Coming soon.
### Method 2 (recommended)
1. Download latest [BepInEx (Reactor fork)](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/BepInEx/releases)
2. Extract all files from zipped archive and put them in Among Us directory (where Among Us.exe is)
3. Download [latest Reactor.dll for 2020.3.5s](https://nightly.link/NuclearPowered/Reactor/workflows/main/master) and put it in `YourAmongUsDirectory/BepInEx/plugins` (you probably have to unzip it first)
4. Download dll from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/among-us/all-mods/crowdedmod/files) and put it in `YourAmongUsDirectory/BepInEx/plugins` (you probably have to unzip it first)

### Method 3 (for security paranoid)
Just compile it yourself.
